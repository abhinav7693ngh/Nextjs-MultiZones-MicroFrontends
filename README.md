Each Folder is a standalone next application.

Open each folder in a separate window and first install the application by running `npm install` and then build them by running `npm build` and finally run  `npm start` for each app to run the build app. Bus and Trains app are connected to base-app using Nextjs Multizones. So just normally go to `localhost:3000` and navigate to all the apps.
